# Car-Sharing-system-using-Blockchain

## Abstract:
The car-sharing sector, which allows car owners to share their unused cars to tenants, making the control rights of vehicles to be frequently transferred among individuals, is rapidly expanding in lines with population expansion, and has just overtaken automobile ownership in popularity.
Customers benefit from blockchain's security since it is a decentralized, immutable, public ledger that is impossible to mess with. The suggested solution's goal is to develop and implement a car-sharing system based on blockchain technology.  
However, classic car-sharing system is based on a centralized database server which can often lead to hacker attacks or password leaks. Moreover, in a classic car-sharing system, the owners of the cars can misuse customers' data. As seen nowadays from a lot of use cases, the best solution to these problematic issues is to use blockchain technology. Blockchain as decentralized, immutable, public ledger provides the customers with security that is impossible to tamper. The aim of the proposed solution is to create and implement peer-to-peer short term car-sharing application based on blockchain technology. 

## About:
The decentralized car-sharing system application is a blockchain based model which will help us to improve car sharing experience by providing faster user experience also there will be very low chances of data breach.
